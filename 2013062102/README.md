==========
This dataset was captured as NAO wandered around a canteen area
containing tables, chairs and a pool table. NAO got a bit tangled up in
the chairs and wandered between two tables. He then made its way under
the pool table and walked towards the legs which it managed to avoid
using sonar.

The dataset contains the following
* JSON files containing timestamps, left & right sonar values and the
  position and orientation of the NAO (6 DOF) in world coordinates
* JPEG files taken by NAO's camera at the time the data in each JSON
  file was captured.
* A video file captured by an external camera of NAO moving about the
  space. This file stops before the end of the run and does not capture
  NAO moving under the pool table. Please note that the time on the
  video is not aligned with the timestamps in the data.

The JSON and JPEG files have the same prefix and differ in
extension. Each file has a unique index after the common prefix which
identifies the dataset.
